    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 thinly sliced boneless chicken breasts (or cutlets)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>12 slider buns, split</li>
      <li>1 tomato, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>12 fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>
        1 (8 ounce) package BelGioioso burrata cheese, sliced to include filling
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Cut chicken breasts in half to fit a slider bun. Season both sides of
        chicken with salt and pepper. Lightly oil a grill or pan-grill over
        medium heat. Grill chicken until no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes
        per side. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toast buns by grilling them cut-side down. For each sandwich, layer
        cooked chicken breast, tomato slice, fresh basil leaf, and burrata slice
        between the toasted slider buns.
      </li>
    </ol>
